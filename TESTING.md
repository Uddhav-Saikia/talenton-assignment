## Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)

### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

```bash

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import ProductCard from '@/components/ProductCard';

test('renders product name', () => {
  const product = { id: '1', name: 'Test Product', ... };
